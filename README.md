# Analyzing-Employee-Exit-Surveys
In this project, I analyzed data on exit surveys from the Department of Education, Training, and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. The goal was to find out how many employees resigned due to some kind of job dissatisfaction, and how age and years of service contributed to it.
